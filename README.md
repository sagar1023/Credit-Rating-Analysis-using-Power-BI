2. Mailer Response Report:

Offer Acceptance by Mailer Type:
Visualized the acceptance rates of credit card offers based on different mailer types (Letter vs. Postcard).

Reward Type Distribution:
Designed a pie chart to display the distribution of customers by reward type preference (Air Miles, Cash Back, Points).
